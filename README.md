# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, we have built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present interactive visualizations of belly button biodiversity data within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in JSON format, D3 was used to import and process the data, while Plotly was used to generate the required visualizations.

#### Questions

1. What is the demographic information of the individual associated with each specific belly button sample?
2. What are the top ten Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by concentration in each specific belly button sample?
3. What are the concentrations of all the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in each specific belly button sample?
4. What is the weekly wash frequency of each specific belly button sample?
